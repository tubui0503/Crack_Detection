# Crack_Detection
- We create an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is able to classify and detect road cracks.
- Folder Faster_R-CNN_Object_DÃªtction contain Dataset, file map name allcities.csv and functions to deploy.
- Crack_detection is a google colab file.
- To save model, create a file in folder Model so Pytorch can save parameter into it.

# End to end model
- Run code in file End_to_End_Crack_Detection.
- Use this : python detect.py --input input/name.jpg (Ex: python detect.py --input input/7.jpg).
- The predicted image will be stored in the output folder.
